<!--
Please target the `master` branch in priority.
PRs can target `3.x` if the same change was done in `master`, or is not relevant there.

Relevant fixes are cherry-picked for stable branches as needed by maintainers.
You can mention in the description if the change is compatible with `3.x`.

To speed up the contribution process and avoid CI errors, please set up pre-commit hooks locally:
